I would like to set up a set of exercises that flexes more of a language than 
"Hello World", but isn't so specific as Project Euler. Exercises aren't 100%
the same between languages, but the idea behind each exercise should be
present in each file. 

I'll keep adding new exercises and languages as I have time. Current languages
are Java and Python. Current exercises are generating primes, and ____.

Completion:
Lang   Exercises Completed
Java   .
Python .
